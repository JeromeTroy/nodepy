Overview
---------

NodePy (Numerical ODEs in Python) is a Python package for designing, analyzing,
and testing numerical methods for initial value ODEs. Its development was
motivated by my own research in time integration methods for PDEs. I found that
I was frequently repeating tasks that could be automated and integrated.
Initially I developed a collection of MATLAB scripts, but this became unwieldy
due to the large number of files that were necessary and the more limited
capability for code reuse.

NodePy represents an object-oriented approach, in which the basic object is a
numerical ODE solver. The idea is to design a laboratory for such methods in
the same sense that MATLAB is a laboratory for matrices.
