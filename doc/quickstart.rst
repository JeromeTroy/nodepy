Obtaining NodePy
================

The current development version of NodePy can be obtained via Mercurial::
    
    hg clone http://bitbucket.org/ketch/nodepy

If you don't have mercurial, you can download it from 
http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/.

Alternatively, the last release version of NodePy can be downloaded 
from http://www.kaust.edu.sa/davidketcheson/NodePy.

Installing NodePy
====================

Simply add the directory
containing the nodepy directory to your Python path.  In csh, the command is::

    $ setenv PYTHONPATH '<path/goes/here>'

NodePy Documentation
====================

NodePy documentation can be found at 
http://www.amath.washington.edu/~ketch/NodePy/docs.

The documentation is also included in the nodepy/doc directory, and can
be built from your local install.  However, you will need to have Sphinx
and JsMath installed on your system for this.

Examples
====================

NodePy comes with some canned examples that can be run to confirm
your installation and to demonstrate capabilities of NodePy.
These can be found in the directory nodepy/examples.
