Installing NodePy
====================

The only installation that needs to be done is to add the directory
containing the nodepy directory to your Python path.  In csh, the command is::

    $ setenv PYTHONPATH '<path/goes/here>'

NodePy Documentation
====================

NodePy documentation can be found at 
http://www.amath.washington.edu/~ketch/NodePy/docs.

The documentation is also included in the nodepy/doc directory, and can
be built from your local install.  However, you will need to have Sphinx
and JsMath installed on your system for this.

Examples
====================

NodePy comes with some canned examples that can be run to confirm
your installation and to demonstrate capabilities of NodePy.
These can be found in the directory nodepy/examples.
